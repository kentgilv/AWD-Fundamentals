    <h2>1. Variable Declaration</h2>
    <p>Variables are containers for storing data values, a memory location for a data type. Variables are created using a declaration or keyword that varies across languages.

    Variable names are usually alphanumeric, that is, they contain a-z and 0-9. They can also include special characters like underscore or the dollar sign.
        
    Variables can hold values of any data type supported by the programming language. This value may change during program execution.</p>

    <h2>2. Input and Output</h2>
    <p>Input and output, or I/O is the communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What is your name?</p>
    <input id="name" type="text">
    <p id="name"></p>
    
    <h2>3. Conditional Statements</h2>
    <p>Conditional statements in programming are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These statements allow the execution of different code blocks depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false, providing a fundamental mechanism for decision-making in algorithms. </p>

    <button type="button" id="on-switch"> On</button>
    <button type="button" onclick="OffSwitch" id="off-switch">Off</button>

    <h2>4. Looping Statemnets</h2>
    <p>Loops or Iteration Statements in Programming are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. They're essential as they reduce hours of work to seconds</p>
